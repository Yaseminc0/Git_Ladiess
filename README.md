Hello Girls!

This project is created to practice using git and git commands, and solving java practice tasks at the same time. 
Classes and tasks: we will have packages with your names and classes inside it, which will contain your solutions of tasks you will receive.
Methods (solutions) should be static so it can be called in Main method without creating an object. Important: please solve your task at CodingBat
first to ensure you passed all test cases there.

Branches strategy: In this project we have 2 main branches: master and develop.
If you watched git course videos you already know that each of you will have your own branch where you will write your code, after that you will merge your branch (branch with your name) and develop branch.

Important: Please ensure you always working in your branch (branch with your name).

The only class all group will work in - will be Main class.
